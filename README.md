# nnInitializations
An Exploration of Neural Network Parameter Initializations

I tried a bunch of different strategies for initializing neural networks in reasonable ways.
None of them worked any better than <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.01852">He et al.</a>.

If you want to look at the logs, check use tensorboard on any of the directories.

If you want to read the paper, it's the pdf in the repo.
